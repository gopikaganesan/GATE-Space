# Welcome to Gopika's GATE Space
- This webpage is created to track Gopika's GATE Preparation progress.
- You can clone the repository to customize as per your requirement.
- Currently this webpage contains 3 view themes, go ahead and explore.
- You are welcome to make contributions to this project.
- Our aim is to help not only GATE Aspirants, but also any fellow human to acheive anything smoothly with free accessible technology.

# Current Features
`Theme Switching`, `Progress Tracking`, `Edit Name` and `Play Music`.
-

- Themes Available: `Blink Mode`, `Walker Mode` and `LLIT Mode`.
- Progress Data are fetched from `Google Sheets` through `AppScript API` as `json` format.
- Landing page directs you to enter name, this feature is added for user's accessibility, evenmore you'll have option to edit when you hover on the Name.
- Play Music is simply a spotify embedded playlist, but the playlist differs as per you change and save the theme.

# Known Issues
- Progress circle with value, style update according to the theme selection. It changes only when you reload, I've tried a code, you can look into the `main.js` file for reference. I will try fixing someday in future (not assured on next update).
- Some modes Agenda BG or Header BG may be not upto your taste, Again you are welcome to create your own version also I'm open to suggestion.
- Console warning or errors (Apart from data fectching) may occur because of Spotify embedded and Canva link attachement for Agenda. I have noticed while testing them.
- Anyways you are welcome to provide fix to known or unknown issues as your contribution.

# Why?
**Vanilla JavaScript and not any framework**: To publish freely through free github account!. Just like our aim, access free technology resource.

**This Webpage**: I've tried looking for apps and websites to track my progress for free. Obviously there are many resources available but I wasn't satisfied with their view or features, they were not up to my taste, even there are few apps available but there are required to pay. As I used to be Front-end Developer (Angular) professionally (few months), so why not create my own. I also had a plan on creating extension - a blink theme - to cheerup during progress, but I never tried or started it, so I incorporated with this.

**Publishing! Instead you can have it locally**: As a person who is self preparing and only relying on free resources and ChatGPT to learn and get prepared for GATE, you need someone to cheer on, so I'm publishing so that the person who is gonna track and cheerup also can look into the progress. And to the note, I can access on mobile browser or any remote browser whenever needed.

**Webpage! Spreadsheets would have been easier, since you track data from Sheets**: Yeah, I found modidying Sheets difficult espessically with progress bar, code is fun for me and again the above answers, lol.

# What you can expect someday in future?
- Obviously fixes if possible.
- How it works information especially Google Sheets and AppScript incorporation.
- Maybe easy to customize format, like Google forms for get data and generating easy to do your own space document.
